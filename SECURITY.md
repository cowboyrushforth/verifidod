# TPM-FIDO Security Hardening Guide

This document provides a comprehensive security assessment and hardening recommendations for the TPM-FIDO application. The recommendations focus on ensuring that authentication always requires both TPM and fingerprint verification without fallback mechanisms.

## IMPLEMENTED SECURITY FIXES

The following security fixes have been implemented:

1. ✅ **Dependency Updates**: Updated to Go 1.22 and latest security-patched libraries:
   - `golang.org/x/crypto v0.37.0`
   - `github.com/google/go-tpm v0.9.3`
   - `github.com/godbus/dbus/v5 v5.1.0`

2. ✅ **Authentication Flow Hardening**: 
   - Modified server struct to track authentication status for both factors
   - Both TPM and fingerprint verification now required for all operations
   - No fallback authentication paths allowed

3. ✅ **Race Conditions and Thread Safety**:
   - Improved thread safety in Pinentry with atomic operations
   - Added exponential backoff for fingerprint verification
   - Enhanced error handling for network or device issues

4. ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Created secure logging package with different severity levels
   - Added security event tracking for critical operations
   - Improved caller information and timestamps in logs

5. ✅ **Input Validation and Defense in Depth**:
   - Added validation package to check all user inputs
   - Implemented key revocation mechanism
   - Added tracking of security-critical operations

6. ✅ **Secure Configuration Management**:
   - Created configuration package with secure defaults
   - Enforced dual-factor requirements at the configuration level
   - Added FIPS-compliant security settings

7. ✅ **Service Hardening**:
   - Enhanced systemd service with comprehensive security restrictions
   - Implemented device access controls
   - Added proper privilege separation

## Security Testing

Security tests have been added to verify:
- Dual-factor authentication enforcement
- No authentication fallback paths exist
- TPM and fingerprint status tracking
- Proper error handling and security events

## Usage Instructions

Please see the updated INSTALL.md file for installation and usage instructions, including:
- How to set up fingerprint authentication
- Secure service installation
- Key revocation procedures
- Compromise recovery steps

## Additional Recommendations

For maximum security:
1. Regularly update the application and dependencies
2. Implement periodic key rotation (90-day suggested)
3. Monitor logs for unauthorized access attempts
4. Use hardware-based TPM 2.0 modules rather than firmware TPM
5. Enforce strong PIN policies for fingerprint fallback (if used)
